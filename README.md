## Problem domain :
* Early detection is a critical factor to control the COVID-19 spreading. The most common screening method to detect it is (RT-PCR) testing. However, it is a laborious method and some studies reported its low sensitivity in the early stages. So as an alternative approach, we can use chest scan X-ray images to identify morphological patterns of lung lesions linked to the COVID-19 using deep machine learning.
## Project idea :
* By applying the principles of deep machine learning, we can design a diagnostic medical program on which we can upload a chest X-ray of a patient and determine whether or not he has COVID-19.
* **MVP** : It can determine the infection with an accuracy of greater than 80%
